<h2> My top 3 movies in 2023</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Shanty Town</h3>
 <p>I actually love how they represented the state of Lagos in recent times and how they were able to depict the vices and rancours by these so called mafias in the movie</p>

 <h3>Sunflower</h3>
 <p>A nice piece that ended well deservedly </p>

 <h3>Brotherhood</h3>
 <p>Haha Tobi Bakre really outdid himself in this movie as he portrayed the mastermind and brain box of the robbery faction. He portrays the local lingua that says "Boss no dey die for film"</p>
